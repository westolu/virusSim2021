Luke Weston VirusSim 2021 final version

THIS IS A SIMULATION, FOR RESEARCH AND EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. 
DISTRIBUTION OF EDITED CODE IS STRICTLY FORBIDDEN
This program is rated for 14+ due to scary content (viruses and sickness)
This simulation assumes even mixes of race, no other viruses in the population.

To run this program, install XChart (instructions included in my writeup)
then, right click on the Grapher class and click the first option, "void main(string[] args)" and press enter
and the program will run.

Thanks for using my program!
